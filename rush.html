						<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
						<div class="row">
							<div class="6u 12u(mobilep)">
								<h3>What is Rush?</h3>
								<br	/>
								<p>Rush is a three week period where fraternities sponsor events to recruit new members. Brothers host events in which interested students can meet and greet Delta Sigma Iota, which allows us an opportunity to get to know you and you get to learn about us. All events are fun, informative and are a representation of our fraternity. At the end of the rush process, brothers will convene and decide if you would be a good fit for the fraternity and you will be extended an interview. The interview is the last step in the rush process in deciding whether you will receive a bid. There are no obligations during rush throughout the entire process, from the first event all the way to the interviews. </p>

								<h3>What is Delta Sigma Iota?</h3>
								<br	/>
								<p>Delta Sigma Iota is one of the youngest multicultural organizations founded at Pennsylvania State University in 2000. Even though we may be young, we have made an impact on campuses around the country by upholding our pillars; Service, Education and Unity. The brothers of Delta Sigma Iota cultivate their minds to becoming leaders in the community and bring forth new and innovative ideas to break the barriers of the past. Brothers of Delta Sigma Iota strive to spread truth, promote academics and integrate culture to enhance the community around us.

							</div>

								<h3>Why is Delta Sigma Iota the fraternity for me?</h3>
								<br />
								<p>Quality over quantity. Brothers of Delta Sigma Iota pride themselves on the tight knit unity that they have with each other. With a selective process and a growing atmosphere, each member can lead the men around him to higher goals while respecting those who paved the road who his success. In the past few years, Delta Sigma Iota has grown immensely on campus and is gaining an increasing presence on campus. We are the only multicultural organization on the International Fraternity Council Executive Board and are expanding nationally.

						<h2>New Member Education Process</h2>
						<div class="row">
							<div class="6u 12u(mobilep)">
								<h3>Requirements to Rush</h3>
								<br	/>
								<p>At Rutgers University, you are unable to join Greek life your Fall semester of your Freshman year. As part of the university policy, you cannot take part in the new member education process unless you have a minimum 2.5 GPA. However, Delta Sigma Iota has raised our own GPA minimum to a 2.7 this past year to make sure new members follow our pillar of Education.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="6u 12u(mobilep)">
								<h3>What is the New Member Education Process?</h3>
								<br	/>
								<p>Delta Sigma Iota follows a strict NO HAZING policy. We do not find any reason to ever physically harm a new member. The process is approximately 8 weeks long and will teach you the values that each and every brother before you has learned. To many of the brothers in the fraternity, the new member education process is seen as the most rewarding experience as a brother.</p>

								<div class="6u 12u(mobilep)">
									<h3>Will my grades drop if I take part in the New Member Education Process?</h3>
									<br	/>
									<p>With education being one of our pillars, we do not allow for any new member’s grades to falter while they are partaking in the new member education process. Our scholarship chair keeps a track of the progress of each new member throughout the semester and sees if anyone is struggling in any classes. Based on the classes that you are taking, upperclassmen brothers that have taken the class in previous years will talk to you and tutor you to make sure you do well. Our Omicron class has the highest GPA out of any new member class during their semester and the Xi class received the second highest GPA during theirs. Education always comes first, no matter what the circumstance.</p>
								</div>
								<div class="6u 12u(mobilep)">
									<h3>Will I have the time to partake in the New Member Education Process?</h3>
									<br />
									<p>Yes, you will. Many brothers have taken part in the new member education process while working, taking classes, and partaking in multiple extra-curricular activities. We understand that everyone has responsibilities outside of the education process and we will allow you time to balance everything. </p>

						<h2>Expectations of Brothers</h2>
						<div class="row">
							<p>Brothers of Delta Sigma Iota are expected to have a <b>minimum</b> of a 2.5 GPA to be active for the semester.

						<h2>Basics of Greek Life</h2>
						<div class="row">
							<p>The beginning of every semester marks the start of rush. The three week process of rush ensues with brothers getting to know the rushes as well as the rushes looking to see what fraternities they fit into the best. As rush week concludes, you may be given an interview for a fraternity in which the brothers get to see you in a more professional setting. If at the end of everything the brothers decide they see you fitting into the fraternity, they will extend you a bid to go through the new member process. </p>
								
							<p>Each fraternity or sorority has a New Member Educator who will be in charge of your new member education process and teach you the values or traditions of the organization. Once you finish the new member education process, you are initiated into the fraternity and are finally a brother. Delta Sigma Iota has been culminating their new member education processes with probates for the past few semesters. A probate is a event you put on at the end of the semester with your pledge class and your New Member Educator to show the Rutgers community what you’ve learned throughout the process and the progress you have made as an individual in the past few months. After the probate, you are done with your new member education process and embark on life as a brother of Delta Sigma Iota. </p>
							
							<p>Delta Sigma Iota strictly adheres to the Office of Fraternity and Sorority Affairs’ (OFSA) no hazing and alcohol policy. <a href="http://greeklife.rutgers.edu/hazing-prevention/hazing-information/">Read more</a> about the OFSA policy of hazing prevention.</p>
